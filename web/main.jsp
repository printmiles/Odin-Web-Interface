			<h3><span>What is Odin?</span></h3>
			<p class="p1"><span><acronym title="Open document and information network">Odin</acronym> is an application aimed at addressing the problems of storing documents for long periods of time: How are the files kept readable? How can I find a document?</span></p>
			<p class="p2"><span>With the ever increasing amount of data being generated in today's society we need to ensure that we can access this data (or at least what we consider worth retaining) in the future. With file formats becoming obsolete along with the programs that are required to open them we need to address how we can access digital data in the future.</span></p>
			<p class="p2">Odin seeks to address these issues by storing documents and metadata (information about the documents) in a central repository. Documents of particular types can then be converted from one file type to another as and when needed. While documents are held within the repository they can be searched for and viewed in their current state. </p>
