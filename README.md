Odin-Web-Interface
==================

Odin web front-end for metadata retrieval from an Odin repository. Documents submitted to the Odin repository will be allocated a GUID to identify it within the archive. Using the URL of this web-page and the GUID argument the metadata can be retrieved from the repository via SOAP. The URL complete with GUID could be encoded as a 2D barcode (Datamatrix or QR Code) which can then be read by a smartphone or similar and the metadata displayed about the document. This might prove useful in correlating paper archives to electronic counterparts.
